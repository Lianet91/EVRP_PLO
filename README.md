The Electrical Vehicle Routing Problem with Public Line Options is Logistics problem that considers a delivery scenario with time windows, where a set of delivery robots must serve a set of customers. In their routes, these robots can travel under their battery consumption or use the metro lines system to cover part of their journey towards customers. The customers have a delivery time window to be respected and the objective is to minimize the travelled distance on street paths and to comply with the time window constraints, by generating the lowest waiting time possible at the customer nodes.
The project is ready to run, and the only requirements to guarantee its proper functioning are having Python and the commercial solver Gurobi installed on a high-performance PC capable of supporting the required computational workload.
